            <p>The World Open CyberSecurity Association (WOCSA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving global cybersecurity awareness, education, and solutions through open collaboration. WOCSA truly believes that Cybersecurity is a public thing and everyone is part of it.</p>
            <p>I am an actively involved member of WOCSA, contributing to the creation of new workshops focused on IoT. I participate in Ethical Hacking workshops, Cyberjutsu sessions, and actively promote the organization. Since joining WOCSA, I have had the privilege of leading workshops and engaging with newcomers, professionals, and cybersecurity enthusiasts. WOCSA provides me with an incredible opportunity to make a meaningful civic contribution within a non-profit organization whose values align closely with my own.</p>
            <p> In Cybersecurity, too, knowledge only increases in value once shared ! </p>

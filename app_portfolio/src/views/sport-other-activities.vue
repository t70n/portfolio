                    <p>After many years of practicing martial arts (see my earlier post), I’ve discovered another sporting passion: rock climbing. I mainly do bouldering, drawn to the sport for both its physical demands and the mental challenge it presents.</p> 
                    <p>Every climb requires strategy and problem-solving, making it as much a test of the mind as it is of strength and agility.</p>
                    <p>Over the next few months, I plan to upgrade my climbing by tackling lead climbing and outdoor routes.</p>

                    <h2 class="centered">Music</h2>
                    <p>As a child, I started playing guitar at my town’s music school, where I developed a passion for the instrument. I played in several bands through the Rockschool initiative. Later, I took up drums to mix things up and explore new joys.</p>
                    <p>More recently, when I started at ENSEEIHT, I joined a band called NightSuze, a rock cover band playing artists like Muse, Måneskin, Bruno Mars, and more (see the photo from our first gig at the student union).</p>
                    <p>Currently, I’m leaning toward a more classical style, finding joy in playing video game soundtracks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Obscur:_Expedition_33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a>.</p>

                    <p>Jujitsu combat is a dynamic martial art that combines striking, throws, and ground control into a full-spectrum, strategic sport.</p>
                    <p>The fight is divided into three phases: striking (atemi), throwing (nage-waza), and groundwork (ne-waza). Competitors score points by executing clean, controlled techniques while ensuring the safety of their opponent. It’s a discipline that emphasizes precision, speed, and self-control.</p>
                    <p>What I love about jujitsu combat is its philosophy. It’s not just about winning—it’s about growth, respect, and discipline. These values are reflected in the Dojo Kun, which encourages practitioners to uphold sincerity, perseverance, integrity, and mutual respect, both on and off the mat.</p>

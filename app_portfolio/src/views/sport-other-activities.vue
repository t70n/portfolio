            <h2>Ju-jitsu Combat</h2>
            <p>Jujitsu combat is a dynamic martial art that combines striking, throws, and ground control into a full-spectrum, strategic sport.</p>
            <p>The fight is divided into three phases: striking (atemi), throwing (nage-waza), and groundwork (ne-waza). Competitors score points by executing clean, controlled techniques while ensuring the safety of their opponent. It’s a discipline that emphasizes precision, speed, and self-control.</p>
            <p>What I love about jujitsu combat is its philosophy. It’s not just about winning—it’s about growth, respect, and discipline. These values are reflected in the Dojo Kun, which encourages practitioners to uphold sincerity, perseverance, integrity, and mutual respect, both on and off the mat.</p>

            <h2>Guitare</h2>
            <p>Having played guitar during my middle school years, I was thrilled to pick up the instrument again by joining the Zik club at ENSEEIHT. I now play electric guitar in Night Suze, a rock-oriented band. Here’s a photo from our first concert at the FOY in N7!</p>
